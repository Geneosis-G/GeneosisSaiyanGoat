[b]DEV NOTES[/b]
[quote=About this mod]If I remember correctly, this was one of the very first suggestions to be added to the request thread... But I was leaving it near the end of the list because I had no clue how to do the particle effects needed for it X)
Anyway, lots of game updates came out, and we now have plenty of beams and trails to make decent Ki Blasts and Kamehamehas :p So what do we have here: Hovering (old good Angel Goat ability), more jumps (that's a feature of the game) and two energetic attacks.
The first one I made was the Ki Blast, as it was very close to some items I made already. It's a sort of mix between the laser sword from Hero Goat and the homing missiles from Attack Helicopter ^^ Basically a ball homing to the cursor when you shoot it, with a nice energy trail, and doing some damage on impact.
Then I had to work on the beam... I had really bad memories of last time I tried to work with one of these (in Engineer Goat) because I had to hack into the way the beam effect was designed really hard to have it working X) Hopefully, this time I used the beam from the Waste of Space ships, not the one from the Cows. And even if I got some trouble to get the coordinates of both sides of the beam right, this beam is way easier to manipulate and configure than the other :)
Last part I added to the beam was the actual repulsion force. This was quite hard to optimise so that it will not attempt to push too many items while getting all those inside the beam radius, but I think the current solution is good enough : You might get lag spikes but at least the game won't crash when using it :p
